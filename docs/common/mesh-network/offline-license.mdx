:::info
To sync data entirely offline without ever synchronizing with the Big Peer, you
will have to request an offline-only license. If you just want to try Ditto for free, you should 
use [OnlinePlayground](../security/online-with-authentication) or [OnlineWithAuthentication](../concepts/online-playground).
:::

Offline license tokens are required to use [OfflinePlayground](../mesh-network/offline-license#offline-playground),
[Manual](../how-it-works/certificate-security), and
[SharedKey](../security/shared-key) identities.

## Request a license 

To request a license, go to your app in the Ditto portal and find the
__Offline License Tokens__ section. Press the **Request offline license** button
to get started. Your license request will be sent to a Ditto engineer and we
will soon contact you in order to generate an offline license for your app. Your
license will appear here once it has been generated.
