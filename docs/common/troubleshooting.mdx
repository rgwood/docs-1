1. Turn Bluetooth Scanning on
1. Are permissions set correctly? See [installation](../installation).
1. Go to your OS-level permissions for Bluetooth and clear the app permissions for your application.

1. Go to your OS-level permissions and clear the app permissions for your application.
1. Delete the app, install it again, and open it. Does it ask for location permissions?

### Local Area Network (LAN)

1. Are permissions set correctly? See [installation](../installation).
1. Are both devices connected to the same WiFi network?
1. Check your router settings and see the [LAN troubleshooting guide](./mesh-network/supported-transports/#local-area-network).

#### Did your device connect to the internet?

`OnlinePlayground` applications must connect to the Big Peer first
*before* going offline. [Read more about online playground](./mesh-network/online-playground).

If your app need full offline access without ever connecting to the Internet, please
request an [offline license token](./mesh-network/offline-license).

### Online with Authentication

1. Did you follow the [tutorial](./guides/authentication/intro)?
1. Is the website address behind `https` and available on the open Internet? 
1. Verfiy that your server is reachable by the Big Peer at `https://APP_ID.ditto.live` and `https://cloud.ditto.live`.
1. Are you implementing the [authentication expiring soon](./security/online-with-authentication#creating-your-client) delegate?
1. Verify that your webhook provider name is [correctly copied in the Ditto portal](./security/online-with-authentication#login).

### Offline Playground and Shared Key

1. Login to the [Ditto Portal](https://portal.ditto.live).
1. Check the value of your offline license token in the Ditto Portal. Is the offline license token expired?
1. Is the offline license token copied correctly?
1. Is the shared key copied correctly? [Generate a new shared key.](./security/shared-key)
